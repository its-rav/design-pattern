# Design Pattern

## Intro
This repository contains code samples for learning design patterns in C#, Golang, and Python. It provides helpful resources for understanding the concepts and working through various examples to better acquaint oneself with designing applications with design patterns in the various languages.

So, what exactly are design patterns?
### Wat da hell is it?
> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

> Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code. - [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

### Why?

Hey, trust me bro, you might manage to do just fine as a software engineer without knowing any of this. Going through some of them, you will figure out you might have been implementing it unwittingly. But yea below is why you need them:

- **Tested, proven development paradigms** - everyone has used it for a while, "for a while" I mean who know how long, it just very very long time ago. *Hey! Trust the elders!*
- **Godspeed development process** - imagine facing a problem and you just know right away how to solve it *Oh shit I recognize this, we can just use Observer*
- Use it instead of coming up with a more shitty solution!
